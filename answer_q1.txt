Addding more residual blocks will increase the runtime for training the model, as there are
more parameters to learn in the network. Theoretically, the more parameters in the network
the better the output will be. In practice, after a certain threshold many parameters 
become redundant (don't add anything to the weights) + the network may overfit the data.
